This policy applies to all employees and aims to foster a culture of continuous improvement, professional growth, and open communication between employees and management.\nPerformance Planning and Goal Setting\nAt the beginning of each performance cycle, employees and their supervisors will collaborate to set clear, achievable, and measurable performance goals. These goals should align with the company\u2019s strategic objectives and take into account the employee\u2019s job responsibilities, professional development, and career aspirations.\nOngoing Feedback and Communication\nThroughout the performance cycle, employees and supervisors are encouraged to engage in regular, constructive feedback and open communication.
